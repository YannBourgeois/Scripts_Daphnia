### XP-CLR (http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/reich/Reich_Lab/Software.html) is a powerful test allowing to detect selective sweeps by scanning allele frequency spectrum changes at linked loci between two populations
### It requires files to be in a specific format (as usual in bioinformatics. Could you imagine a world where every software uses, for example, vcf format?)
### In this example, we start from a vcf with allele calls (file1.vcf). In Population1.txt is a list of individuals from one of the populations to compare.
vcftools --vcf file.vcf --keep ../Population1.txt  --012 --out Population1

 awk '
{ 
    for (i=1; i<=NF; i++)  {
        a[NR,i] = $i
    }
}
NF>p { p = NF }
END {    
    for(j=1; j<=p; j++) {
        str=a[1,j]
        for(i=2; i<=NR; i++){
            str=str" "a[i,j];
        }
        print str
    }
}' Population1.012 > Population1.out
 
 
 sed -i -e "s:0:0 0:g" Population1.out
 sed -i -e "s:-1:9 9:g" Population1.out
 sed -i -e "s:1:0 1:g" Population1.out
 sed -i -e "s:2:1 1:g" Population1.out
 tail -n +2 Population1.out > Population1.clr
 
 ###Population1.clr should contain the genotype data in the right format. Proceed the same way for all the .012 files that you need.
 ### A map file is also needed and can be obtained "easily" from the .vcf

       -p corrLevel
-xpclr:		specify the input file format.[XpCLR accepts several other 
                 input formats, but currently they haven't been checked 
                 carefully yet.]
genofile1:	genotype input for object population
genofile2:	genotype input for reference population
mapfile:	snp information file (for SNPs from a single chromosome) 
outputfile:	The format is illustrated in next section.
-w1:		set it to "-w1"
gWin:		the size of a window (in units of Morgan). If the window size is
                 not too small, the performance of XPCLR doesn't depend on the 
                 size. A reasonable choice is 0.005.
snpWin:		maximum # of SNPs within a window. XPCLR score depends on the 
                 number of SNPs. To make the XP-CLR scores comparable between
                 regions, it is necessary to control the maximum number of SNPs
                 within a single window. The choice of snp # depends on the 
                 SNP density of your data.
gridSize:	the spacing between two grid points. It is in unit of bp.
chrN:		the chromosome number.
-p: "-p1": 	specify this if the genotype data is already phased.
    "-p0": 	specify this if the genotype data is unphased.
		The phase information of the genotype is used only if 
                 corrLevel is set to be >0. When corrLevel >0, the XP-CLR score 
                 is estimated using a weighted scheme. The weights come from
                 the pairwise correlation between SNPs in the reference pop.
                 If "p1", the phased data will be used to estimate pairwise 
                 correlation coefficient directly; if "p0", pairwise correlation
                 coefficients are estimated with an EM algorithm.  
corrLevel:	the range of its value is on [0 1]. If it is on (0 1], this 
                 corrLevel value is used as a criterion in the weighted 
                 composite likelihood ratio test. If two SNPs are highly 
                 correlated (r2 > corrLevel), their contribution to XPCLR 
                 is down-weighted. 
                 If corrLevel is set to be 0, XPCLR is estimated un-weightedly.
