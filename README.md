All scripts used for the genomic study of Zosterops borbonicus color patterns


Color polymorphisms are now a classical theme in evolutionary biology. As they can
be easily characterized they allow for precisely studying the links between genotypic and
phenotypic changes. However, if studies in controlled conditions with model or near-model
species have provided a dramatic database for genetic bases of coloration, few is still known
about the genetic architecture of polymorphisms occurring in natural populations. Here we
used a genomic approach to assess whether genes already described in melanic color
polymorphism in Vertebrates could explain the patterns observed in an endemic bird from
Réunion, Zosterops borbonicus. We show that a region mapping on the zebra finch’s
chromosome 1 displays highly significant patterns of association with coloration in three
distinct localities. Interestingly, this region does not seem to include any gene already
described as affecting feather or hair color. However, several interesting candidates remain,
all involved in intra-cellular trafficking. Our results are a further indication that even for
traits such as discrete colour variation where phenotypic convergence is common, genetic
convergence is not necessary the rule.
